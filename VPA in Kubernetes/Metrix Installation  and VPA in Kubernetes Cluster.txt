Metrix installation in Kubernetes cluster.

Ensure the Metrics Server is Installed: You can install the Kubernetes metrics server by applying the official manifest.
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml

Verify Metrics Server Installation: After applying the manifest, confirm that the metrics server is up and running:
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metrics-server

lets view the metrix of nodes
kubectl top node

Check Metrics Server Logs for Errors: The first step is to inspect the logs of the metrics server to check if it's having trouble collecting or serving metrics.
kubectl describe deployment metrics-server -n kube-system

kubectl logs -n kube-system deployment/metrics-server


Allow Insecure TLS Skips for Metrics Server: You can configure the metrics server to skip TLS verification. This can help resolve the certificate validation issue. Modify the metrics server deployment by adding the following flag to the container's args:
kubectl edit deployment metrics-server -n kube-system

Add the following argument under the args section:
- --kubelet-insecure-tls

The args section should look something like this:
containers:
- args:
  - --cert-dir=/tmp
  - --secure-port=10250
  - --kubelet-insecure-tls
