ClusterIP Service

Default Service Type:
When you create a service without specifying a type, it defaults to ClusterIP.

Access Scope:
Internal-only service, meaning it is accessible only within the cluster.
Pods can communicate with the service using the internal cluster IP, but external traffic (outside of the cluster) cannot reach it directly.

Usage:
Ideal for internal communication between microservices or within the cluster.

Deployment YAML Example:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  #namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80


Service YAML Example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
  #namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP

Access:
Pods communicate via the service name (nginx-service) or the internal cluster IP assigned to it.
External users cannot directly access the service.

Use Case:
Used when your service is only needed within the cluster, such as in microservice architectures where one service communicates with another service.
