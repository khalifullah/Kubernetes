NodePort Service

Access Scope:
Exposes the service to external traffic by opening a specific port (in the range 30000-32767) on each node in the cluster.
External users can access the service by reaching any node's IP address using the specified NodePort.

Usage:
Used when you want to expose a service to external clients without using a LoadBalancer.
Useful in environments where a LoadBalancer service is not available or for local development/testing.

Deployment YAML Example:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  #namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

Service YAML Example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-nodeport-service
  #namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30036 # Optional: specify a port in the range 30000-32767
  type: NodePort

Access:
To access the service externally, you need to use the node's IP address and the specified NodePort (e.g., http://<node-ip>:30036).
This will forward traffic from the node's port to the service's targetPort on the respective pod.

Use Case:
Useful when testing services locally or on a cloud where a LoadBalancer isnâ€™t required.
Can also be used as a quick way to expose a service for external access in a development environment.
